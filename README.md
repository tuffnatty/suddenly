suddenly
========

suddenly is a finite-state morphological analyzer especially effective for agglutinative languages. It employs a domain-specific language to define morphological segmentation rules in pluggable language modules. It is written in Forth language, using GForth as the officially supported implementation.

Currently the following language modules are being tested:

* Khakas
* Old Turkic
